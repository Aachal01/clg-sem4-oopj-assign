/* Design a base class shape with two double type values and member
functions to input the data and  compute_area() for calculating area of figure. Derive two classesâ€™
triangle and rectangle. Make  compute_area() as an abstract function and redefine this function in the derived
class to suit their  requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and displays calculated area.
Implement dynamic binding for given case study.
